<h2>Father Brown and other characters</h2>
<p>What is so innocent about Father Brown? He is a small, humble priest who also happens to be a good detective. Why is he <strong>such a good detective?</strong> He often hears confessions of criminals, which only <strong>adds to his knowledge</strong> of how people act. <a href="http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/innocence/title.html">Read the book</a> to see Father Brown&#8217;s uncanny detective sense.</p>

<h2 id="excerpt">&#8220;The Queer Feet&#8221;&#8212;An excerpt</h2>

<p>Father Brown&#8217;s way of solving mysteries is very rational. Here is an excerpt from Chapter 3 that presents <strong>some of the evidence</strong> that Father Brown used to solve the mystery of &#8220;The Queer Feet.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/innocence/qrfeet.html">
<p>The priest began a little to allow his thoughts to wander and his animal senses, which were commonly keen, to awaken. ... When he became conscious of the thing he found what it was: only the ordinary patter of feet passing the door, which in an hotel was no very unlikely matter. Nevertheless, he stared at the darkened ceiling, and listened to the sound.</p>
<p>The footsteps outside at any given moment were such as one might hear in any hotel; and yet, taken as a whole, there was something very strange about them.</p>
<p>First, there came a long rush of rapid little steps, such as a light man might make in winning a walking race. At a certain point they stopped and changed to a sort of slow, swinging stamp. ... The moment the last echoing stamp had died away would come again the run or ripple of light, hurrying feet, and then again the thud of the heavier walking. ... Father Brown had the kind of head that cannot help asking questions; and on this apparently trivial question his head almost split. ... Why on earth should a man run in order to walk? Or, again, why should he walk in order to run? Yet no other description would cover the antics of this invisible pair of legs.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is the explanation of these mysterious footsteps? <a href="http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/innocence/title.html">Read Chapter 3</a> to find out.</p>
